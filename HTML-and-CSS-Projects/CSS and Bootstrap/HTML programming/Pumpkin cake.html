<p><h2>Baked pumpkin cake - Method of preparation<br></h2>
    Cut the pumpkin into slices and place in a baking tray lined with baking paper.
    We bake it in the oven preheated to 200°C and leave it until it softens perfectly.
    We take it out of the oven and after it has cooled a little, we mash it until we get a fine puree.
    Put the egg yolks, half the sugar and vanilla in a bowl and mix with a spoon for about 2-3 minutes, 
    until you get a homogeneous mixture.
    Add the melted and cooled butter over the cold pumpkin puree and a pinch of salt and mix until homogenized, 
    milk can also be added to this composition.
    Beat the egg whites separately with the other half of the sugar until they harden and add them to the pure pumpkin.
    We sift the flour mixed with the baking powder, add it to the dough in 3 steps and mix.
    The final consistency of the pumpkin cake batter is denser and I think this is due to the type of pumpkin I used.
    We put the dough in the form coated with butter and flour, carefully level the surface and bake it in the oven preheated 
    to 170°C for 30-40 minutes.
    Before taking it out of the oven, check if it is cooked and poke it with a toothpick. 
    If it comes out clean, the cake is ready, if it comes out a little wet, bake it for another 5 minutes.</p>
